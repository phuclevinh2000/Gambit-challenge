# What is this project

This project is the GAMBIT challenge from GAMBIT.
The option that was chosen is Option 2: Create UI for showing the data for user

# ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD

NOTE: Since this is a challenge that requires authentication, I used firebase cloud for this purpose, and the user name and password is set as:

Username: admin@example.com
Password: 123456

# What is missing?

The convertion for BCD type (register 49-56) has not been done yet since did not found the correct logic to convert
